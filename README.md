## Data availability and setup

First, open the CMU Datashop dataset webpage in your browser.

https://pslcdatashop.web.cmu.edu/DatasetInfo?datasetId=5371

To access the datasets, you will need to request access with an account on DataShop. You can create an account using your Google or GitHub account, whichever is easiest.

Once you have created an account, navigate back to the dataset webpages and click on the button `Request Access`. Provide your reasoning to access the dataset and click `Confirm`. You should receive an email once the PI approves the request; however, you can also check by seeing whether you can click the `Export` button on the project webpage.

Now that you have permission, you can get the first two CSVs needed for the project by clicking `Files (X)` where `X` is a number, and then clicking `Files (X)` again if no datasets are shown. Click the file names of the relevant CSVs to download them.

To get the final datasets, click the `Export` button. On the left hand side, make sure under `Shared Samples` that there is a checkbox next to `All Data` by clicking it. Then, click the `Export Transactions` button when it appears. Wait for the server to process your request, and then you should have three files `ds*_tx_All_Data_*_<timestamp>.txt`.

Currently, only the American sample is available for research purposes.
